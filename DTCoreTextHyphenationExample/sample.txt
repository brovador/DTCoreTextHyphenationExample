<strong>Alice</strong> approaches a large table set under the tree outside the March Hare’s house and comes across the Mad Hatter and the March Hare taking tea. They rest their elbows on a sleeping Dormouse who sits between them. They tell <strong>Alice</strong> that there is no room for her at the table, but <strong>Alice</strong> sits anyway. The March Hare offers <strong>Alice</strong> wine, but there is none. <strong>Alice</strong> tells the March Hare that his conduct is uncivil, to which he rejoins that it was uncivil of her to sit down without being invited. The Mad Hatter enters the conversation, opining that <strong>Alice</strong>’s hair “wants cutting.” <strong>Alice</strong> admonishes his rudeness, but he ignores her scolding and responds with a riddle: “Why is a raven like a writing desk?” <strong>Alice</strong> attempts to answer the riddle, which begins a big argument about semantics. After their argument, the tea party sits in silence until the Mad Hatter asks the March Hare the time. When he discovers that the March Hare’s watch, which measures the day of the month, is broken, the Mad Hatter becomes angry. He blames the March Hare for getting crumbs on the watch when the March Hare was spreading butter on it. The March Hare sullenly dips the watch in his tea, dejectedly remarking that “It was the best butter.”
